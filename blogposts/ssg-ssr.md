We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request. You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

&nbsp;

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Pariatur assumenda atque mollitia ullam nesciunt saepe repellat quos quaerat enim officia! Voluptatem voluptate atque commodi vitae labore dolores, dolorem nesciunt aliquid.
  

&nbsp;

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.
On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.
In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data. Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur doloribus cum at error architecto deserunt ducimus aut sint obcaecati minus! Adipisci delectus voluptatum, minima commodi facere molestias? Harum officiis nam similique ab quis, id sint laboriosam et repellendus perspiciatis libero voluptate ratione ipsa. Distinctio, illo veritatis unde quidem necessitatibus adipisci!
